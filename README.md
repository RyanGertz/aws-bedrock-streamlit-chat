## What This Code Does

This project demonstrates how to create a fully functional AI chatbot web application. The code:

1. **Creates a Web Interface**: Uses Streamlit to build a chat-like user interface
2. **Manages Conversations**: Maintains message history and context throughout the chat
3. **Connects to Claude**: Uses AWS Bedrock to send messages to Anthropic's Claude model
4. **Handles Real-time Updates**: Displays messages immediately and shows thinking indicators
5. **Provides Error Handling**: Gracefully manages connection issues and API errors

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need:

### 1. Python Installation
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your computer
- You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. AWS Account Setup
- An AWS account
- AWS credentials configured on your computer
- Access to AWS Bedrock service and Anthropic Claude model

### 3. Required Python Packages
Install the necessary packages by running this command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install streamlit boto3
```

## Understanding the Code

### Key Components

**Streamlit**: A Python library that makes it easy to create web applications for data science and AI projects. It handles all the web development complexity for you.

**Session State**: Streamlit's way of remembering information between user interactions. This is crucial for maintaining chat history.

**AWS Bedrock Converse API**: A newer, more efficient way to communicate with Claude that handles message formatting automatically.

**Real-time Updates**: The app updates immediately when users send messages, creating a smooth chat experience.

### The Functions Explained

#### Function 1: `get_bedrock_client()`
This function creates and caches the AWS connection:
- Uses Streamlit's `@st.cache_resource` decorator to avoid recreating the client
- Connects to AWS Bedrock in the us-west-2 region
- Returns a reusable client object for making API calls

#### Function 2: `invoke_model(messages: List[Dict[str, str]])`
This function handles communication with Claude:
- Takes the full conversation history as input
- Converts Streamlit message format to Bedrock's expected format
- Sends the conversation to Claude using the converse API
- Returns Claude's response or an error message if something goes wrong

#### Main Application Logic
The main part of the code handles the user interface:
- Sets up the page configuration and title
- Manages session state for conversation history
- Displays all previous messages in chronological order
- Handles new user input and generates AI responses
- Updates the interface in real-time

## How to Run the Code

1. **Save the code**: Clone this repo or copy the code into a file called `chatbot.py`

2. **Open your terminal/command prompt**

3. **Navigate to your project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**: Streamlit will automatically open your default browser to `http://localhost:8501`

6. **Start chatting**: Type a message in the input box and press Enter to chat with the AI!

## Customizing The Code

### Change the App Appearance
Modify the page configuration:
```python
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="My Custom Chatbot", 
    page_icon="ðŸš€",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)
st.title("ðŸš€ My Custom AI Assistant")
st.write("Welcome to my personalized AI helper!")
```

### Adjust AI Response Settings
Modify the inference configuration:
```python
response = client.converse(
    modelId="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
    messages=bedrock_messages,
    inferenceConfig={
        "maxTokens": 2000,  # Longer responses
        "temperature": 0.7,  # More creative responses
        "topP": 0.9,  # More diverse responses
    }
)
```

### Add System Instructions
Give your chatbot a personality:
```python
# Add this before the user messages
system_message = {
    "role": "system", 
    "content": "You are a helpful coding tutor who explains concepts clearly with examples."
}
bedrock_messages.insert(0, system_message)
```

### Add a Sidebar with Settings
Include user controls:
```python
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Settings")
    temperature = st.slider("Creativity", 0.0, 1.0, 0.7)
    max_tokens = st.slider("Response Length", 100, 2000, 1000)
    
    if st.button("Clear Chat"):
        st.session_state.messages = []
        st.rerun()
```

## Understanding the Interface

### Chat Display
The app shows a conversation flow similar to popular messaging apps:
- **User messages**: Appear with a user icon
- **AI responses**: Appear with an assistant icon
- **Message history**: All previous messages remain visible
- **Thinking indicator**: Shows when the AI is processing

### Session Management
The app maintains conversation context:
- **Persistent history**: Messages stay visible across interactions
- **Context awareness**: The AI remembers previous parts of the conversation
- **Fresh start**: Restart the app to clear conversation history

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "No module named 'streamlit'"
Install the required package:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

### "Port already in use"
If port 8501 is busy, Streamlit will automatically try other ports:
- Check the terminal output for the correct URL
- Or specify a different port: `streamlit run chatbot.py --server.port 8502`

### "No credentials found"
This means your AWS credentials aren't set up. You need:
- AWS Access Keys configured
- AWS CLI setup or environment variables
- IAM permissions for Bedrock

### "Access denied to model"
Your AWS account might not have permission to use Claude:
- Check your AWS Bedrock model access in the console
- Ensure you have the correct model ID
- Verify your IAM permissions include bedrock actions

### "Connection timeout"
Network or AWS service issues:
- Check your internet connection
- Try a different AWS region
- Verify AWS service status

### App doesn't update after sending message
This usually means the rerun() isn't working:
- Check for any errors in the terminal
- Restart the Streamlit app
- Ensure you're using the latest version of Streamlit

## Important Notes

- **Cost Awareness**: Each message exchange costs money (usually a few cents per conversation)
- **Rate Limits**: AWS has limits on how many requests you can make per minute
- **Session Persistence**: Messages are only saved while the app is running
- **Local Development**: The app runs on your computer by default

## Use Cases for AI Chatbots

This type of chatbot application is useful for:
- **Customer Support**: Automated assistance for common questions
- **Educational Tools**: Tutoring and learning assistance
- **Content Creation**: Writing help and brainstorming
- **Code Assistance**: Programming help and debugging
- **Research Assistant**: Information gathering and analysis
- **Personal Assistant**: Task management and reminders

## Getting Help

If you run into issues:
1. Check the terminal output for detailed error messages
2. Verify your AWS credentials are working
3. Ask our camp staff for assistance
4. Test with a simple message first
5. Check the Streamlit documentation for UI issues

## Example Conversations

Once running, you can try conversations like:
- **User**: "What is machine learning?"
- **AI**: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence..."
- **User**: "Can you give me an example?"
- **AI**: "Sure! A great example is email spam detection..."

The chatbot maintains context throughout the conversation, making it feel natural and helpful.

## Extending This Project

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a document", type=['txt', 'pdf', 'docx'])

# Model selection
model_choice = st.selectbox("Choose AI Model", 
    ["Claude 3.5 Sonnet", "Claude 3 Haiku", "Claude 3 Opus"])

# Export conversations
if st.button("Export Chat"):
    chat_export = json.dumps(st.session_state.messages, indent=2)
    st.download_button("Download Chat", chat_export, "chat.json")
```
